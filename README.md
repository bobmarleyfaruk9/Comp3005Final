Installation: Assumed that client has node, npm and sqlite3 installed on their machine.
              - cd into project directory
              - npm install
              - node server.js
              
How to use it: After starting the server (as described above) visit http://localhost:3000/books?title=Lord or change the "Lord" with whatever you want to search.
              
What can it do : The program is rather premature. All it can do now is searching for books in the given database and showing the information on the chosen books. (Also, approximate search for books feature has been implemented as a bonus) 

Note: Adding new books to the database was in progress but I didnt have enough time :( (Still html file is there)
